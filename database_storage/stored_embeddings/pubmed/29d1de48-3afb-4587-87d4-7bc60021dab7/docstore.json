While limiting the number of procedures, it meets two prerequisites: (1) to save the patient's life, thanks to early weight-bearing, to limit decubitus complications; and (2) to save knee function and patient autonomy, thanks to early knee mobilization. There are 3 main indications: complex articular fractures in elderly patients with symptomatic osteoarthritis prior to fracture; complex articular fractures of the tibial plateau in elderly patients whose bone quality makes internal fixation hazardous; and major destruction of the distal femur in younger patients. Although admitted in emergency, these patients require adequate preoperative management, including a multidisciplinary approach to manage comorbidities, control of anemia and pain, and assessment and management of vascular and cutaneous conditions. Preoperative planning is crucial, to order appropriate implants and materials that may be needed intraoperatively. Surgical technique is based on the basic principles of revision surgery as regards choice of implant, steps of reconstruction, bone defect management and implant fixation. For complex fractures of the distal femur, primary temporary reduction is a useful \"trick\", to determine the level of the joint line and femoral rotation. Complementary internal fixation may be required in case of diaphyseal extension of the fracture and to prevent inter-prosthetic fractures. In the literature, the results of primary TKA for fracture are encouraging and better than for secondary TKA after failure of non-operative treatment or internal fixation, with lower rates of revision and complications, earlier full weight-bearing and better functional results. Loss of autonomy is, however, frequent, and 1-year mortality is high, especially following complex femoral fractures in the elderly.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2055, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a8408e8b-e778-4f3b-997b-ffad3323c918": {"__data__": {"id_": "a8408e8b-e778-4f3b-997b-ffad3323c918", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title of this paper": "Autologous Minced Cartilage Implantation for Treatment of Chondral and Osteochondral Lesions in the Knee Joint: An Overview.", "URL": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32715735/"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "1b9b1cbd-5aa3-4bd1-84d4-b1f9632d79b6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title of this paper": "Autologous Minced Cartilage Implantation for Treatment of Chondral and Osteochondral Lesions in the Knee Joint: An Overview.", "URL": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32715735/"}, "hash": "780b1db7a369f51bb085721175f3fea7af87d421c2e5ec53bf0f6155db7b8887"}}, "hash": "780b1db7a369f51bb085721175f3fea7af87d421c2e5ec53bf0f6155db7b8887", "text": "Cartilage defects in the knee are being diagnosed with increased frequency and are treated with a variety of techniques.

The distinction between local cartilage defects and large area degenerative cartilage lesions is very important for both prognosis and surgical therapy. The size and position of the lesion, the underlying pathomechanism and the age of the patient are very important factors which should be considered in the therapy algorithm for optimal cartilage defect restoration. Important cofactors such as stability, long leg axis and muscle balance should be taken into account.\nAIM: Current procedures for cartilage repair of the knee joint and their results are summarized in this article. In addition, the necessity of precise and comprehensive preoperative clinical and radiological diagnostics is displayed to be able to treat co-pathologies in order to enable a\u00a0successful repair of the cartilage defect.\nRESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative planning of cartilage-repair techniques usually includes x\u2011ray images and a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examination. If MRI is not available, an arthro-computed tomography could be an alternative. Modern and routinely used procedures for cartilage repair at the knee joint are microfracture, autologous matrix-induced chondrogenesis, autologous chondrocyte transplantation, matrix-induced autologous chondrocyte implantation and osteochondral transplantation. Successful surgical cartilage-repair surgeries require a\u00a0correct and individualized indication, addressing of copathologies and a\u00a0standardized rehabilitation that is adapted to the surgical procedure.

Total joint arthroplasty represents the only valuable, established surgical option for severe, end stage OA. For hip and knee OA, it is by far the most common surgical procedure and provides considerable pain relief, functional restoration, and improved quality of life. Surgical therapy aiming to postpone OA essentially addresses extra- or intraarticular pre-osteoarthritic deformities, defined as congenital or acquired disturbances of the joint structure that adversely affect its function. Approaches in this category include osteotomies and different cartilage repair procedures such as osteochondral autograft and allograft transfer, marrow stimulation techniques, and autologous chondrocyte implantation. However, they are not only less commonly performed than arthroplasty, but the scientific clinical evidence in favour of this type of surgery to reduce the long-term risk of developing OA is considerably reduced.\nCONCLUSION: Total knee and hip arthroplasty are two of the most successful procedures in all of medicine. As the progression of this insidious disease is often asymptomatic and slow, it is imperative to judge reparative procedures at their potential to reduce OA development at long-term, besides their primary clinical outcomes.
