It is possible that altered gait mechanics after unilateral TKA play a role in the progression of contralateral OA progression.\nRESEARCH QUESTION: The purpose of this study was to identify biomechanical predictors of radiographic OA progression in the contralateral (non-surgical) knee after unilateral (primary/initial) TKA. In addition, this study quantified for patients who had contralateral OA progression.\nMETHODS: Biomechanical outcomes were collected 6-24 months after unilateral primary TKA and were used to predict changes in contralateral OA severity at follow-up. Participants were divided into \"Progressor\" and \"Non-Progressor\" groups based on changes in Kellgren-Lawrence (KL) OA grade and Joint Space Width (JSW) between baseline and follow-up testing sessions. Biomechanical factors during walking were peak knee adduction moment, knee flexion/extension excursions, knee angle at initial foot contact, and peak knee flexion/extension. Multiple independent t-tests were used to examine the magnitude of differences in biomechanical variables between the groups. Logistic regression was used to examine the association between the biomechanical predictors and change in KL scores and JSW.\nRESULTS: The mean time between surgery and follow-up x-rays was 8.8 (2.4) years. Of 40 participants, 62.5-78% had contralateral radiographic knee OA progression by follow-up. There were no significant differences in the biomechanical variables between groups. For the regression analysis, none of the biomechanical variables were found to be predictors for contralateral OA progression.\nSIGNIFICANCE: Although abnormal biomechanics are known risk factors for primary knee OA, it is possible that the mechanisms that result in OA progression of the contralateral limb are different than primary knee OA progression. Future work should evaluate other objective measures of OA progression and determine if cumulative measures of joint loading are related to OA worsening.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2083, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e3475494-52df-49f4-95c5-ec7115fafecc": {"__data__": {"id_": "e3475494-52df-49f4-95c5-ec7115fafecc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title of this paper": "Spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee: what do we know so far?

The aim of this paper was to review the literature on this field published until now, discuss the results of both conservative and surgical treatment options, as well as to introduce new methods of treatment, which may be applicable in SONK treatment.\nMETHODS: We searched the PubMed and Cochrane databases until November 2019 and presented the most recent findings in this work.\nRESULTS: The exact aetiology of SONK still remains unclear; however, recent studies suggested that early stage of SONK is rather a result of the subchondral fracture than primary osteonecrosis. So far described conservative treatment includes non-weight bearing or protected weight bearing with a knee brace, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, analgesics, and bisphosphonates. Surgical management includes arthroscopic debridement, core decompression, osteochondral autograft, high tibial osteotomy, and unicompartmental knee arthroplasty or total knee arthroplasty.\nCONCLUSIONS: Although the aetiology of SONK remains unknown, there are many treatment options, and the choice of the most suitable one is challenging.

There was a significant effect of exercise type on proprioception scores after controlling for pretest values (p< 0.05).

These references were then reviewed for additional references and crossed back to the original description (when possible) of these named tests.\nSTUDY SELECTION: All articles that discussed the sensitivity and specificity of the physical examination maneuvers were extracted. This information was reviewed for accuracy and then summarized.\nDATA EXTRACTION: Multiple MEDLINE and text searches were performed by using the terms of the test maneuver, the joint tested, and the term physical examination. Any article with this information was reviewed until the article describing the original description was found. Articles dating from that original article to the present were reviewed for information on the sensitivity and specificity of the test.\nDATA SYNTHESIS: Literature reviewing the sensitivity and specificity of the tests reviewed is summarized in text and table form. The Lachman test seems to be very sensitive and specific for the detection of anterior cruciate ligament tears. For posterior cruciate ligament tears, the posterior drawer test is also very sensitive and specific and is enhanced with other tests, such as the posterior sag sign. For meniscal tears, the McMurray test is very specific but has a very low sensitivity, whereas joint line tenderness has fairly good sensitivity but lacks good specificity. Although collateral ligament testing seems to be sensitive and specific, there is a lack of well-designed studies that scientifically validate the sensitivity and specificity of these tests. Common tests for patellofemoral pain and patellar instability lack sensitivity when correlated with pathologic operative findings.\nCONCLUSIONS: Most physical examination tests could be referenced back to an original description, with variable information on the sensitivity and specificity along with other information about the validity of these tests in clinical practice. To standardize how physical examinations are performed and compared, they should follow the original description or agreed-on standards. In addition, the significance of a physical examination finding must be understood to ensure that patients with knee complaints are accurately diagnosed and properly treated.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2587, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}}, "docstore/ref_doc_info": {"eba34603-5b49-4f6e-9632-de11888de52b": {"node_ids": ["2183c6c8-2e85-49ce-9d22-6971b7044696"], "metadata": {"Title of this paper": "Total knee arthroplasty in the varus knee: tips and tricks.", "URL": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30141140/"}}, "66149c17-c54d-45c9-bd81-adad9d2f4437": {"node_ids": ["79cc2b8b-6b3a-4269-a0c3-d9867825a53d"], "metadata": {"Title of this paper": "Knee biomechanics and contralateral knee osteoarthritis progression after total knee arthroplasty.", "URL": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34775230/"}}, "d5a09839-2ce9-4a84-b859-4fd8af0b563f": {"node_ids": ["e3475494-52df-49f4-95c5-ec7115fafecc"], "metadata": {"Title of this paper": "Spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee: what do we know so far?
