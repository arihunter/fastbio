Regular exercise is strongly recommended to these patients due to its cardiovascular and metabolic benefits. However, a large percentage of patients with T1DM people present a sedentary behavior because of the fear of a post-exercise hypoglycemia event, lack of time, lack of motivation and the complicated management of exercise, glycemic and insulin dose interaction. High-intensity interval training (HIIT) is an efficient and safe methodology since it prevents hypoglycemia and does not require much time, which are the main barriers for this population to doing exercise and increasing physical conditioning. (2) Methods: Nineteen sedentary adults (37 \u00b1 6.5 years) with T1DM, were randomly assigned to 6 weeks of either HIIT (12-16-20 \u00d7 30-s intervals interspersed with 1-min rest periods) performed thrice weekly, or to the control group, which did not train. HRQoL, sleep quality, exercise motivation and enjoyment were measured as psychological variables. (4) Results: HRQoL improved in physical and social domains, PF (1.9%); PR (80.3%); GH (16.6); SF (34.1%). Sleep quality improved in the HIIT group by 21.4%. Enjoyment improved by 7% and intrinsic motivation was increased by 13%. (5) Conclusions: We suggest that the 6-week HIIT program used in the present study is safe, since no severe hypoglycemia were reported, and an effective strategy in improving HRQoL, sleep quality, exercise motivation and enjoyment which are important psychological well-being factors in T1DM people.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1621, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "eb3d5310-3b1e-41b1-8709-9384477a275d": {"__data__": {"id_": "eb3d5310-3b1e-41b1-8709-9384477a275d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title of this paper": "Quantitative Redox Biology of Exercise.", "URL": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32455453/"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8fb60f9d-efc1-4bbf-bdfa-78268fab2e72", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title of this paper": "Quantitative Redox Biology of Exercise.", "URL": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32455453/"}, "hash": "e81806227297832e7c555347cf1b30f143fda5f9702327ca58119378bd9452e5"}}, "hash": "e81806227297832e7c555347cf1b30f143fda5f9702327ca58119378bd9452e5", "text": "Biology is rich in claims that reactive oxygen and nitrogen species are involved in every biological process and disease.

In the case of the elderly, the concrete aspects of their health must be known to improve the system, in search of a better quality of life and as much independence as possible.\nMETHOD: The aim of this study was to verify the efficiency of a music therapy program with institutionalized elderly participants to avoid depressive symptoms and improve social interaction and creativity. This is a group case study that uses a pretest-post-test descriptive design. The program was divided into sixteen sessions, two sessions each week. As inclusion and exclusion criteria, physical dependency and cognitive state were used.\nRESULTS: The results present an improvement in the physical dimensions of quality of life and an increase in creativity and social interaction. It is recommended that the sessions in the program, aiming to achieve a greater efficiency, are extended because the elderly have very ingrained habits and routines that are very hard to eliminate.\nDISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Music therapy, a non-pharmacological and worthwhile treatment, is a therapeutic option with proven benefits. Music therapy has the potential to improve health and quality of life in the elderly and also foster the amelioration of various chronic illnesses, such as depression.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1388, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e61cb842-3225-4483-96f5-7c95af98d936": {"__data__": {"id_": "e61cb842-3225-4483-96f5-7c95af98d936", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title of this paper": "Sudden Changes and Their Associations with Quality of Life during COVID-19 Lockdown: A Cross-Sectional Study in the French-Speaking Part of Switzerland.", "URL": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34064382/"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "95183e15-667b-49ec-9ded-c5d59dbc0274", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title of this paper": "Sudden Changes and Their Associations with Quality of Life during COVID-19 Lockdown: A Cross-Sectional Study in the French-Speaking Part of Switzerland.", "URL": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34064382/"}, "hash": "acb01adbe09fe2750d8427ac05b9ca4a02d6ab7fe7828b1597e339db9380bf8e"}}, "hash": "acb01adbe09fe2750d8427ac05b9ca4a02d6ab7fe7828b1597e339db9380bf8e", "text": "The lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic has led to various sudden changes in a large number of individuals. In response, the question of how individuals from different social and economic strata cope with those changes has arisen, as well as how much they have affected their mental well-being. Choosing strategies that cope with both the pandemic and the well-being of the population has also been a challenge for different governments. While a large number of studies have investigated the mental health of people from different populations during the COVID-19 pandemic, few have explored the number and type of changes experienced during lockdown by the general population, alongside their relationships with health-related quality of life (HRQoL). To fill this research gap, an observational cross-sectional study on those associations was conducted in the French-speaking part of the Swiss general population. Data were collected from 431 participants during the first four weeks of lockdown due to COVID-19. Multivariate regressions were used to identify the sociodemographic profile of the population that experienced different types and numbers of changes during this period, the association of those changes with the HRQoL-mental and physical-and infection beliefs, and the perception of the governmental measures. We show that the more changes people experienced, the lower their mental HRQoL; however, adherence to governmental measures has helped people to cope with the imposed changes, even though the number of unexpected and unwished changes have strained their mental HRQoL. The low-income population experienced financial difficulties and changes in their food intake more frequently, while dual-citizenship or non-Swiss individuals declared conflictual situations more frequently. Sport practice had a positive association with mental HRQoL; nevertheless, a decrease in sport practice was frequently reported, which correlated with a lower mental HRQoL. Risk perception of COVID-19 increased with lower physical HRQoL score, which supports the efficiency of governmental communication regarding the pandemic. Our results support that government measures should be accompanied by effective and targeted communication about the risk of infection, in order to encourage all strata of the general population to follow such measures and adapt to the changes without unduly affecting their mental health. The usage of such tools might help to reduce the impact of policy-imposed changes on the mental HRQoL of the general population, by inducing voluntary changes in informed and engaged populations.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2615, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}}, "docstore/ref_doc_info": {"2f04f8f1-ccf9-438b-8421-c99ec9bbdab8": {"node_ids": ["1c3e4ed9-3a49-413a-a89b-786aed658cbc"], "metadata": {"Title of this paper": "Effect of High-Intensity Interval Training on Quality of Life, Sleep Quality, Exercise Motivation and Enjoyment in Sedentary People with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus.", "URL": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34886337/"}}, "8fb60f9d-efc1-4bbf-bdfa-78268fab2e72": {"node_ids": ["eb3d5310-3b1e-41b1-8709-9384477a275d"], "metadata": {"Title of this paper": "Quantitative Redox Biology of Exercise.", "URL": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32455453/"}}, "0a1ac9ac-3ddd-4402-89c0-51b10c946032": {"node_ids": ["32f8af2d-3f49-4122-b8d1-71c3ab1af178"], "metadata": {"Title of this paper": "Can Music Therapy Improve the Quality of Life of Institutionalized Elderly People?", "URL": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35206924/"}}, "95183e15-667b-49ec-9ded-c5d59dbc0274": {"node_ids": ["e61cb842-3225-4483-96f5-7c95af98d936"], "metadata": {"Title of this paper": "Sudden Changes and Their Associations with Quality of Life during COVID-19 Lockdown: A Cross-Sectional Study in the French-Speaking Part of Switzerland.", "URL": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34064382/"}}}}
