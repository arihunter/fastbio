Specimens were randomized into four groups of 16 specimens each. Cavity Protection (Colgate-Palmolive) was the negative control. Whitening dentifrices used were Black is White (Curaden AG); and My Magic Mud (Carbon and Clay Company) containing activated charcoal and Optic White (Colgate-Palmolive) containing hydrogen peroxide. Instrumental color measurements were performed at baseline, 1-week post-brushing, 30-day post-brushing, and 1-month follow-up. Another set of bovine teeth (n= 64) used for roughness measurements were embedded in acrylic resin and the surface ground flat. The experimental groups and brushing protocol were the same as for the color evaluation part. Surface roughness was measured with a contact type profilometer at baseline and after the last brushing session. Kruskal-Wallis procedure tested changes in color and surface roughness among the different groups. All post-hoc comparisons were conducted with Bonferroni corrections. Tests of hypotheses were two-sided with an alpha level at 0.05.\nRESULTS: Overall color change was not significantly different among groups at 1-week post-brushing and at 1-month follow-up. However, the hydrogen peroxide group had a significantly higher reduction in chroma in the yellow-blue axis when compared to negative control group at 30-day post-brushing and 1-month follow-up (P< 0.05). There was no significant difference in roughness among the groups at baseline (P= 0.2973) and post treatment (P= 0.8169).\nCLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The use of charcoal dentifrices did not have the claimed whitening effect but did not increase enamel surface roughness.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1837, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1c579694-5aa9-4062-9de2-17b36af9926c": {"__data__": {"id_": "1c579694-5aa9-4062-9de2-17b36af9926c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title of this paper": "Why do I have white spots on my front teeth?", "URL": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19418768/"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c4e8a4d0-df73-47dd-888e-1c60171203a9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title of this paper": "Why do I have white spots on my front teeth?", "URL": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19418768/"}, "hash": "261856ed215f834b06bcc4d7116346c64ff47db0f7628905942dead3a9dc32bf"}}, "hash": "261856ed215f834b06bcc4d7116346c64ff47db0f7628905942dead3a9dc32bf", "text": "Aesthetics have always been important in mainstream society.

Reisman, Co-Director, Yale Internal Medicine Residency Writers' Workshop, Assistant Professor, Department of Internal Medicine, Yale University School of Medicine and VA Connecticut Health Care System: This issue inaugurates a new feature: selected writings from the Yale Internal Medicine Residency Program's Writers' Workshop. The annual workshop began in 2003. Abraham Verghese and Richard Selzer, among the best known physician-writers in the United States, have served as workshop leaders, teaching the craft of writing to more than 35 residents. In designing the workshop with my co-director, Dr. Asghar Rastegar, our aim was to make participants better physicians by providing a creative outlet for reflection. The tempo of a resident's day is typically furious - one patient dies, perhaps, another sickens, a third refuses a necessary procedure, a fourth's wife cries inconsolably at the bedside - with no time in between to ponder what happened, much less what it meant to the patient or to the resident and how it might shape the way the resident practices medicine in the future. Without time to muse about the experience, many residents take the easy road: They emotionally detach. Writing, we believe, can be an antidote to this tendency. The exercise of writing not only makes us empathic; it also sharpens our diagnostic skills. One of the keys to compelling writing is attention to detail: the nervous twitch of an old man's eye muscles or the decayed front teeth of a young woman, a former crack addict. Such details not only make our writing come alive but also sensitize us to our patients' plights and sharpen our diagnostic skills. The stories and essays written by the Writers' Workshop participants present a range of experiences, real and imagined, and take us deep into the minds of young doctors trying to make sense of what they do.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1877, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}}, "docstore/ref_doc_info": {"b6d34fd4-085e-43ad-b519-a9c0e4699fdd": {"node_ids": ["49da2f72-42eb-4333-848b-11b1b390855b"], "metadata": {"Title of this paper": "Look at my pearly white teeth: Exploring adolescents' oral health behavior.", "URL": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30536620/"}}, "52d806a5-f944-4357-afad-5af6dc6b697e": {"node_ids": ["6e0e4cf2-8eb4-4039-9c09-918164051309"], "metadata": {"Title of this paper": "Effect of charcoal dentifrices on tooth whitening and enamel surface roughness.", "URL": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35051315/"}}, "c4e8a4d0-df73-47dd-888e-1c60171203a9": {"node_ids": ["1c579694-5aa9-4062-9de2-17b36af9926c"], "metadata": {"Title of this paper": "Why do I have white spots on my front teeth?", "URL": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19418768/"}}, "f66474ba-3fe8-4d23-82ac-e72c489446d9": {"node_ids": ["89ace87b-05cc-4fed-8bea-72764d341419"], "metadata": {"Title of this paper": "Why do I have white spots on my front teeth?", "URL": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18402380/"}}, "51c820c2-9fe1-4a3c-869e-62925cc9cfb5": {"node_ids": ["10f3caca-7257-4d2a-8456-35c51625c1db"], "metadata": {"Title of this paper": "Beyond the white coat ceremony.", "URL": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17876374/"}}}}
